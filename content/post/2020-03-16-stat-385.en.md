### 10:45 P.M.

[Ha's Stat 385 Page](https://nkha149.github.io/stat385-sp2020/)

#### Week 1
* Objects/ Variables <- (Dice)
* (Atomic) Vectors c(Fruit Medly)
* Vector [indexes] 
* Built In function(arguements) {}

During the first week of class, we learned about how to communicate with R.

#### Week 2

* Data Types: Double, Integer, Character, Logical, Complex and Raw
* Lists [[vector]][list]
* Matrix [array of dimension 2,]
* Array [n,dim,array]
* dim(dice)<-c("changes dim of object")
* attributes(object) <-c("one")
* names(die)<-c("give","names","to","dice")

During the second week,we learned about types of objects we can show R

#### Week 3

* Changing Values (describe value) <-c(then, assign) [note:can assign values that don't exist]
* Data Frame (changing data a row/column at a time), create new columns data$new_column <- 
* Logical Subsetting: Tests that yield T or F. Example 1>c(0,1,2) TFF Note: %in% test if left is in object on right
* Logical operators for subsetting: deck[deck$face == "ace",] Tests column for TRUE, then TRUE elements in object are shown 
* Boolea Operators, Place boolean operators between 2 logical tests, Element wise
* If Statement If condiiton is True, then {} Note: Single TF statement
* Else Statement, condition is false
* Plotting hist(objects), boxplot(objects), scatterplot(plot(objects))

R's IQ is pretty high

#### Week 4

* For Loops repeat code block for every element in an input object or set, for (value in x) {} Value = arguement. Can be used tofill up a vector as for loop runs element by element
* While loops runs code while condition is TRUE. Code block must change argument as it runs
* Repeat Loops will run until it hits break
* Vectorizing Code for Speed: use subsetting to extract elements into a vector, then manipulate whole vector

Week 4 we learned about For, While, and Repeat Loops as well as vectorizing code for speed. I learned that R can run faster if he is trained properly.

#### Week5-7

* github: Online place to store projects that can be opened to other collaborators
* Main functions: Pull(Download to computer), add(add changes to local files), commit(lock in changes in local files), and push (update cloud with files)
* Can use github to host website

Weeks 5 through 7, I learned that R can communicate with Github who manages files online.

#Some R Code:

Object <-c("character",number,integer) #Tells R to create an Object
dim(Object)<-c("one","two")  # Tells R to Change the dimensions of the object
Object[#,]<-c("anything") #tells R to change the data inside the object to something else
function(x){Some random actions} #tells R to create a function that takes x and does something to it
